          <p id='main-p'> Self-taught programmer. Switched careers and relocated to consolidate my newfound coding passion. But why coding? I am crazy about creating new things and acquiring new skills! I see coding as a skill that has unlimited potential and provides me with a medium to create beautiful and meaningful things that can improve others lives. I have experience managing teams and leading projects and am a firm believer that teams that have more fun communicate better and do better quality work.
